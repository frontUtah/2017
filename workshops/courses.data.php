 	'description' => "You’re an experienced product practitioner who has a love of mentoring and an ambition for leadership but are not sure where to start. To make that shift you need to arm yourself with some tactical skills around building a team, developing a team, and even having the hard conversations needed to keep the team healthy. In this workshop, we will be breaking our time into focusing on these three areas, reviewing tactics and tools, and learning through doing. <br><br>Experience Team Building 101: How to recruit, interview and identify the best person for your team. We will look at strategies for finding amazing applicants, effective ways of interviewing, and things to looks for and consider in selecting a new team member.<br><br>Developing Your Team: Tools to develop your PMs and UX Designers, and create career paths within your organization We will look at defining what career paths exist / should exist in your company, learn to use tools that help us guide a conversation to understand the many dimensions of your team member, and practice ways to select and prioritize actionable things you can work with your team member to improve.<br><br>Conversations: How to manage Product Managers and UX Designers who are dropping the ball. We will talk about one of the hardest and most important parts of leadership, managing team members who are dropping the ball. This is easier said than done. First, we need to understand why the ball is being dropped (system, workload, communication, soft skills, disengagement). If it is a system or workload issue, how do we co-author a solution with the team? If it is a communication or soft skills issue, how do we coach the individual? And if it is a disengagement issue, how do we have the hard conversation with our team member that they must step up or move on." ,

 $courses[] = array(
 	'title' => 'Storyboarding in Product Development',
 	'description' => "Why do so many teams fail to launch products on time? Why do budgets quickly creep beyond initial projections? Why do so many products launch and then, customers fail to adopt the product or feature?<br /><br />It’s because too often, teams jump right into designing and building before they establish their product story –– the deep understanding of how the product fits into people’s lives.<br /><br />Teams often let the weeds of the product details distract them from considering the user as a person. Discussion about people is quickly overshadowed by pixels and code.<br /><br />Storyboarding is a critical activity to product development because it forces us to develop a deeper understanding of the people we are designing for. It forces us to establish the context, characters, and a clear language which creates an anchor that can ground the team and keep the focus on people.",

By establishing and maintaining a company-wide design language and design system implementation, teams are better equipped to ensure consistency, reduce duplication of work, and improve overall design and code quality.<br><br.In this workshop, you will get hands-on experience with initial ideation and planning of a design system, as well as designing initial tokens, components, assets, and usage guidelines. Along the way, we'll discuss common pitfalls and pain points associated with organizing a design system and establishing it throughout a company.",

To be great product leaders, we all want to be right in every decision we make. But this isn’t possible.<br /><br />We face too much uncertainty in our profession. Being wrong is inevitable. Furthermore, trying to be right all the time can lead us to defend our position and pre-existing beliefs.<br /><br />Instead, we should try to be wrong less often.<br /><br />This workshop will cover uncommon mental models (heuristics, frameworks, techniques, and thinking strategies) that product leaders can use to be less wrong. For each model, we’ll introduce the concept and then follow-up with case studies and exercises to practice using it to make decisions in your daily work.",

All of this preparation is required to successfully onboard a new team member, but you don’t have to reinvent the wheel each time you hire someone. Whether you’re hiring rapidly or only hire a couple of people each year, streamlining your onboarding process will save you time, get new hires up to speed faster, and help cultivate the culture you want your team to have. In this workshop, we’ll use BuzzFeed’s onboarding documentation as a case study to illustrate an example of a repeatable and thorough onboarding process. Working in small groups, we’ll define a set of common (and maybe not-so-common!) problems to be solved during onboarding. From there, we’ll put together templates and frameworks that you can take back to your team to level up your onboarding process.",

But all too often, we end up brushing complex business rules and information architecture aside in the name of “low fidelity.” Unfortunately, as we avoid asking hard questions to our users, stakeholders, and developers — while designing features and screens without full context  — we end up with piles of rework. In this workshop, you’ll learn about the four tough questions you should be asking early on—to make the rest of the project easier and more successful.<ul><li>What are the important objects?</li><li>What are their relationships to each other? </li><li>What do users want to do to these objects?</li><li>What is the structure of each object?</li></ul>And then, you’ll learn how to answer these four questions through collaborative, structured, and super-effective exercises. <br /><br />You’ll come out of the workshop with four new facilitation and design frameworks that will help you and your team tackle complex problems with confidence.",
