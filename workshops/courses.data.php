Story mapping is a simple practice for telling the story of a whole product or feature starting by telling the stories of the users who’ll use it. In this fast paced workshop you’ll learn the concepts of story mapping by building a map collaboratively with others. You’ll learn advanced techniques for slicing a map to find small viable product releases, and then how to build your product using smaller stories without losing sight of the big picture.",

PMs, UX designers, and executives all try to drive definition, engineering isn’t brought in early enough, and QA sees a story for the first time when they test it.</br></br>In this workshop, Vicky will share methods and models of working together that have transformed her teams at Adobe, Lucid Software, and Vivint Smart Home. As a participant, you’ll get hands-on practice writing OKRs, crafting the perfect one-pager, navigating the project cycle from wireframes to defined JIRA tickets, breaking down dev work for estimation, and building roadmaps that work.
