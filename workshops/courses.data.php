 	'description' => "You’re an experienced product practitioner who has a love of mentoring and an ambition for leadership but are not sure where to start. To make that shift you need to arm yourself with some tactical skills around building a team, developing a team, and even having the hard conversations needed to keep the team healthy. In this workshop, we will be breaking our time into focusing on these three areas, reviewing tactics and tools, and learning through doing. <br><br><strong>Experience Team Building 101:</strong> How to recruit, interview and identify the best person for your team. We will look at strategies for finding amazing applicants, effective ways of interviewing, and things to looks for and consider in selecting a new team member.<br><br><strong>Developing Your Team:</strong> Tools to develop your PMs and UX Designers, and create career paths within your organization We will look at defining what career paths exist / should exist in your company, learn to use tools that help us guide a conversation to understand the many dimensions of your team member, and practice ways to select and prioritize actionable things you can work with your team member to improve.<br><br><strong>Conversations:</strong> How to manage Product Managers and UX Designers who are dropping the ball. We will talk about one of the hardest and most important parts of leadership, managing team members who are dropping the ball. This is easier said than done. First, we need to understand why the ball is being dropped (system, workload, communication, soft skills, disengagement). If it is a system or workload issue, how do we co-author a solution with the team? If it is a communication or soft skills issue, how do we coach the individual? And if it is a disengagement issue, how do we have the hard conversation with our team member that they must step up or move on." ,

You'll have a toolkit for doing research on your own.<br><br>Many teams talk about doing research, but not enough teams actually do research. One main reason for this is lack of buy in from stakeholders and executives. Another reason is because research is perceived as being expense and time consuming. In this workshop, we’ll walk through the entire research process and understand how to get buy in and how to conduct smart, effective user research.<br><br>The workshop will consist of a brief overview of why research matters so that you can have more informed discussions with team mates and colleagues who don’t buy into research. Then, we’ll take a deep dive into the research process as well as practice doing research on each other based on a mock project that you’ll learn about in the workshop.",

Along the way, we'll discuss common pitfalls and pain points associated with organizing a design system and establishing it throughout a company.",

To be great product leaders, we all want to be right in every decision we make. But this isn’t possible.<br /><br />We face too much uncertainty in our profession. Being wrong is inevitable. Furthermore, trying to be right all the time can lead us to defend our position and pre-existing beliefs.<br /><br />Instead, we should try to be wrong less often.<br /><br />This workshop will cover uncommon mental models (heuristics, frameworks, techniques, and thinking strategies) that product leaders can use to be less wrong. For each model, we’ll introduce the concept and then follow-up with case studies and exercises to practice using it to make decisions in your daily work.",

But all too often, we end up brushing complex business rules and information architecture aside in the name of “low fidelity.” Unfortunately, as we avoid asking hard questions to our users, stakeholders, and developers — while designing features and screens without full context  — we end up with piles of rework. In this workshop, you’ll learn about the four tough questions you should be asking early on—to make the rest of the project easier and more successful.<ul><li>What are the important objects?</li><li>What are their relationships to each other? </li><li>What do users want to do to these objects?</li><li>What is the structure of each object?</li></ul>And then, you’ll learn how to answer these four questions through collaborative, structured, and super-effective exercises. <br /><br />You’ll come out of the workshop with four new facilitation and design frameworks that will help you and your team tackle complex problems with confidence:<br /><br />
 <ul>
<li>Noun Foraging (define the important concepts in your system)</li>
<li>The Nested-Object Matrix (map relationships)</li>
<li>The Call-to-Action Matrix (connect actions to objects)</li>
<li>Object Mapping (build the detailed structure of your system)</li>
</ul>
Together, these methods will give you X-ray vision into the complexity at hand, while also generating a laundry list of questions for further research.",

It’s asking the age-old question, “should we go wider or should we go deeper?” Going wider increases the TAM of your product but it comes with great risk because it’s not a question of just product/market fit but of company/market fit. Going deeper satisfies your current clients but will it expand your revenue?<br /><br />The purpose of this workshop is to develop a methodology to answer this question. We will create a scorecard to help you and your team identify opportunities and risks in order to decide which investments are right for your company.  ",
