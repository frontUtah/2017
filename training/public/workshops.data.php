	'description' => "Creating a consistent cadence of research helps equip your team to always be informed with the most recent insights they need to design the right solution, so you can avoid launching features people don’t use and the weeks of “re-work”. In order to create a cadence of research, it must be a part of your culture. And that can’t just be the job of someone with “UX Researcher” in their job title.</br></br>In this workshop, you will learn how everyone on a product team can contribute to creating a culture of research, the types of research you can do each quarter, how to conduct smart usability tests, and what you can do to evangelize research on your team.",

	'description' => "World-class product teams are greater than the sum of their parts—but how does that happen? Sometimes you’re lucky, and if you put a cross-functional team into a small room, they spit out magic. More often, though, product teams struggle to work together effectively, spending more time bumping into each other than actually building product. PMs, UX designers, and executives all try to drive definition, engineering isn’t brought in early enough, and QA sees a story for the first time when they test it.",
