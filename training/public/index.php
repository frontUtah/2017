								<h4>A Culture of Curiosity</h4>
								<p class="name">by Sarah Doody</p>
								<p class="location"><span class="icon-location"></span>Salt Lake City, UT</p>
								<p class="date-mobile"><span class="icon-location"></span> JUN 21, 2019</p>
								<p class="description">Creating a consistent cadence of research helps equip your team to always be informed with the most recent insights they need to design the right solution, so you can avoid launching features people don’t use and the weeks of “re-work”. In order to create a cadence of research, it must be a part of your culture. And that can’t just be the job of someone with “UX Researcher” in their job title.</br></br>In this workshop, you will learn how everyone on a product team can contribute to creating a culture of research, the types of research you can do each quarter, how to conduct smart usability tests, and what you can do to evangelize research on your team. </p>

								<h4>What Got Us Here Won’t Get Us There</h4>
								<p class="name">by Nick Sloggett</p>
								<p class="location"><span class="icon-location"></span> San Francisco, CA</p>
								<p class="date-mobile"><span class="icon-location"></span> JUL 12, 2019</p>
								<p class="description">In this workshop, Nick will explore his wins, losses, lessons learned, and the framework that guides you to lead relationally - no matter your title or company. Expect to engage in discussion, activities, exploration around the enneagram, extreme ownership, relational empathy, organizational discourse, and true servant-minded leadership.</p>

								<h4>Teamwork Makes the Dream Work</h4>
								<p class="name">by Vicky Thomas</p>
								<p class="location"><span class="icon-location"></span> Boston, MA</p>
								<p class="date-mobile"><span class="icon-location"></span> AUG 05, 2019</p>
								<p class="description">World-class product teams are greater than the sum of their parts—but how does that happen? Sometimes you’re lucky, and if you put a cross-functional team into a small room, they spit out magic. More often, though, product teams struggle to work together effectively, spending more time bumping into each other than actually building product. PMs, UX designers, and executives all try to drive definition, engineering isn’t brought in early enough, and QA sees a story for the first time when they test it.</p>

								<p class="date-mobile"><span class="icon-location"></span> SEP 23, 2019</p>

								<h4>Certified Scrum Product</h4>
								<p class="name">by Jeff Patton</p>
								<p class="location"><span class="icon-location"></span> New York, NY</p>
								<p class="date-mobile"><span class="icon-location"></span> SEP 05, 2019</p>
								<p class="description">Jeff Patton will deliver an honest, irreverent, and extremely useful 2-Day Certified Scrum Product Ownership course. This is a course with a deliberate and unapologetic product-centric and Lean UX bias. If you’ve learned Agile and Scrum basics elsewhere and felt that product and user experience concerns were missing, we’ll fix that.</p>
