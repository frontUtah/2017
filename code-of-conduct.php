			<h2>Code of conduct</h2>
			<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>

			<p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></p>

			<p><strong>Be welcoming: </strong>We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</p>

			<p><strong>Be respectful: </strong>Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Itâ€™s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</p>

			<p><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose: </strong>we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
				<li>Publicly shaming (on Slack, in-person, or otherwise) anyone for any reason.</li>
				<li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
				<li>Posting on Slack sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
				<li>Posting on Slack (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").</li>
				<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
				<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
				<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
				<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
				<li>Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</li>
			</ul>
