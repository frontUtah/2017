	'title' => 'Turning your company into a product centric organization. When you should do it and how to make it happen.  ',
	'description' => "We’ve all been there, working for companies where the product team is more of a cog, in a large wheel, rather than the hub. These product groups are typically pushed around by other teams who are looking out for their self-interests rather than the current strategy of the company. As a result, the product group spends time in all the wrong areas rather than focusing on the items which really matter. Eventually your once talented product team stops having fun and they move on to other opportunities.</br></br>Truth be told, sometimes product shouldn’t be the hub of your organization; but I believe that’s more of an exception than the rule. So, when should the product group be the hub? And how can you position your product group to be leaders rather than followers?  In this session, we will discuss the factors which contribute to successful product groups and each attendee will self-assess their own product group. The purpose is to identify opportunities for improvement and develop a plan to make your group successful.",
