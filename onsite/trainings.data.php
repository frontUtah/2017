	'description' => "Balancing the needs of the users, business, team and yourself is certainly a challenge. As designers we’re naturally wired to defend and create for the needs of the user. Business…wants to stay in business, and Development…wants to build amazing forward thinking technology while not drowning in its own debt.

	'title' => 'How to Establish and Maintain a Design System',
	'description' => "As teams and products grow it can become complicated to maintain consistency across all properties, additionally, there is often a duplication of initial work for each product starting from scratch. By establishing and maintaining a company-wide design language and design system implementation, teams are better equipped to ensure consistency, reduce duplication of work, and improve overall design and code quality.<br><br.In this workshop, you will get hands-on experience with initial ideation and planning of a design system, as well as designing initial tokens, components, assets, and usage guidelines. Along the way, we'll discuss common pitfalls and pain points associated with organizing a design system and establishing it throughout a company.",

How best to work within cross-functional teams is unclear. Retention suffers as designers feel ineffective and their career growth isn’t being given sufficient attention. Recruiting and hiring practices aren’t filling roles quickly enough, leaving gaps throughout the organization. Design leaders can’t devote their energy to creative leadership as operational challenges take precedence. The user experience has lost cohesion as more and more isolated teams contribute to it. <br><br>This workshop provides a framework for shaping your design organization, and a roadmap for how it can grow over time. We will explore different organizational models for design teams, and how they relate to their cross-functional peers. We’ll look at key matters of skills, process, and design leadership to ensure that the team is only delivering high-quality output. We will discuss the stages of evolution for a design organization, and when it makes sense to bring in certain roles and practices, such as UX Research and Design Operations. And we will dig into matters of professional development and people management, with a focus on making team members feel supported not just in their work but their careers." ,

	'description' => "Why do so many teams fail to launch products on time? Why do budgets quickly creep beyond initial projections? Why do so many products launch and then, customers fail to adopt the product or feature? <br><br>It’s because too often, teams jump right into designing and building before they establish their product story –– the deep understanding of how the product fits into people’s lives. <br><br>Teams often let the weeds of the product details distract them from considering the user as a person. Discussion about people is quickly overshadowed by pixels and code. <br><br>Storyboarding is a critical activity to product development because it forces us to develop a deeper understanding of the people we are designing for. It forces us to establish the context, characters, and a clear language which creates an anchor that can ground the team and keep the focus on people." ,

Sometimes you’re lucky, and if you put a cross-functional team into a small room, they spit out magic. More often, though, product teams struggle to work together effectively, spending more time bumping into each other than actually building product. PMs, UX designers, and executives all try to drive definition, engineering isn’t brought in early enough, and QA sees a story for the first time when they test it.<br><br>In this workshop, Vicky will share methods and models of working together that have transformed her teams at Adobe, Lucid Software, and Vivint Smart Home. As a participant, you’ll get hands-on practice writing OKRs, crafting the perfect one-pager, navigating the project cycle from wireframes to defined JIRA tickets, breaking down dev work for estimation, and building roadmaps that work. You’ll leave the session with tools and templates that you can implement right away, and an understanding of how to build the single most important capability of any product team." ,

It's really hard to craft jobs that are specific enough to be actionable, but high-level enough to describe the root of the problem you customer needs to solve.

In the workshop, Gib Introduces four models:<ul><li>The GLEe model, describing what you will “Get big on,” how you will “Lead from there,” then eventually, “Expand to dent the universe.”</li><li>The DHM model, defining your hypotheses, or product strategies, for how you will “Delight customers, in Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing ways.”</li><li>A framework for defining metrics that measure both customer and shareholder value.</li><li>The GEM model, clarifying how you will prioritize Growth, Engagement, and Monetization.</li></ul>At the end of the workshop, Gib will show how these models work together to define a four-quarter, rolling product roadmap that pulls together product strategies, metrics, and tactics. The workshop ends with highly interactive case studies, demonstrating how Gib utilized quarterly product strategy meetings at both Netflix and Chegg to put a strategy into action, or as he puts it, “make wicked hard decisions about people, product, and the business." ,
