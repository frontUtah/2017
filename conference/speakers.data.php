For Ethan, this is not just a mission, it’s a promise. With a highly structured selling platform and multiple integrations, Jane.com provides both online sellers and brick and mortar shops the perfect marketplace to showcase their boutiques, as well as create an attentive audience for new innovative products.<br /><br />Focused on building the future of eCommerce technology. Ethan is known as a talent gatherer, purple squirrel whisperer, and unicorn locator with a reputation for starting big things everywhere he works. Having grown Jane from 100 to 195 employees this past year, Ethan is passionate about building fantastic teams with the right people – big on shaping culture and ensuring best practices through proper scaling. He feels culture is an intentional practice, that it’s an evolution over time, and that requires trust from both employees and management.",
