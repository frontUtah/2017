			<h2>This Is The Place. This Is Salt Lake.</h2>
			<p>The first Salt Palace in Utah was built in 1899 but was destroyed by fire in 1910. An indoor arena with the same name was completed in 1969 and was home to several professional sports teams while hosting concerts and other events. The arena was demolished, and a brand new convention center opened its doors in 1996. Major expansions in 2000 and 2005 increased the buildingâ€™s size to nearly one million square feet. Adjoined to the facility are the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art and Abravanel Hall, home of the Utah Symphony.</p>
			<p>Many of the convention center's most striking visual features were obtained through the creative use of hollow structural steel in exposed applications. The entrance towers, delicate snowflake chandeliers, and grand five-story main concourse make the Salt Palace part architectural showpiece, part modern art sculpture, and ready to be all business.</p>
