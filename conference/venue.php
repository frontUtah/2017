			<h2>Highest standard acts and greatest stars of the stage</h2>
			<p>The Capitol Theatre has been at the center of the Salt Lake arts and culture community since its opening in 1913 as the Orpheum Theatre. Originally a vaudeville house, the Orpheum offered “highest standard acts and greatest stars of the stage.” More than 100 years later, the venue continues to host exceptional events and performers. The Capitol is home to Resident companies Ballet West, Utah Opera and hosts the JazzSLC series.</p>
			<p>There are countless memories contained within our walls. Many Utahns have their first performing arts experience at the Capitol Theatre as a participant or a spectator. For many families, the Holidays are not complete without attending The Nutcracker. Broadway stars including Robert Goulet, Carol Channing, Molly Ringwald, and Marissa Jaret Winkour have played on our stage. Some lucky Utahns even remember when the Capitol was a movie theater and a vaudeville stage!</p>
