	'description' => "Almost every technology based company values the need for Product Management but the way its integrated into the business is different from company to company. Lets talk about where ideas come from, how decisions get made, and what makes the top of the list. We’ll discuss how the business as a whole is involved in this process and strategy. The purpose of a roadmap and what it takes to make it work and the role of the PM in all of it.</br ></br >Our panel of pundits will get into the nitty gritty of what Product Management is, how its executed, where the Product Manager role fits into the equation, and how things can be made better by each.",

	'title' => 'Don’t Try to Design a Design Culture',
	'description' => "Design leaders often fail to truly change their company’s culture because they miss the challenge. You can’t directly design a design culture. In fact, you cannot design a culture at all.</br ></br >During a well-intentioned team revamp, a group of leaders gets into a room, creates a list of company values, and unveils them with posters on the wall. Then they wait. Or, they hires an executive from Apple because they want a culture like Apple’s, and then hope the new hire will make it so. But the culture rarely catches up to Apple or to the posters. Why? Because the leaders are only setting a vision for their culture. Vision is important, but it’s also the easy part. The hard part is changing the underlying organizational system so that desired behaviors emerge on their own.</br ></br >And that’s exactly what design leaders do have the power to shape: the system and the elements that constitute it. These include the physical environment, organizational structure (or lack of one), incentives, processes, tools, roles and relationships. When you focus on the parts of the system that you can actually design, you create the opportunity for a good culture to emerge.</br ></br >In this talk I’ll take a closer look how you can influence your culture in a lasting, sustainable way, including 7 tips I’ve found to be most effective for leaders growing a small startup team or improving an existing culture.",

We'll start with how designers can be most valuable to their team, and cover with how managing communication with your team can help you incorporate feedback into successful designs without loosing your voice.",

	'description' => "Design has been clamoring for a seat at the table for ages. And, all of the sudden it’s happening. Designers at startups and big companies alike are increasingly being brought into leadership discussions. In my job at GV, I see designers across a broad range of companies and I’m very worried that many designers are squandering their leadership opportunity. Let’s talk about how design is perceived by leaders and where design can truly help shape more beautiful companies.",

And of the seven billion people on the planet, there are arguably very few who know what Design is, what a Designer does, or how things are made better because of them. Do Designers even know? Do they care? Does it matter? Really?</br ></br >Our panel of pundits will get into the nitty gritty of what Design is, who Designers are, and how (or IF) things can be made better by each.",

$sessions[] = array(
	'title' => 'Prototyping and the Realism Threshold',
	'description' => "The design tools market has exploded in the past few years, and designers are often left scratching their heads and wondering which tools best fit their needs. In this talk, I propose that design tools should be chosen based on outcomes instead of features, and outline methods to create convincing prototypes for user testing purposes. I look to other industries to better understand the foundations behind prototyping and soliciting real feedback. I discuss three different kinds of prototypes and how the the Product Design team at Lucid Software crafts compelling experiences.",

While both groups have similar goals and objectives, misunderstandings of over roles, responsibilities, and process can get in the way of effective collaboration. Drawing on a decade of experience working together, Josh Penrod, VP of User Experience at Ancestry, and Kendall Hulet, SVP of Product at Ancestry, will share war stories about their time together building successful, collaborative relationships between Product and UX while learning great (and not so great) ways to build, revamp, and kill products.",

	'description' => "Every Product Manager is faced with a never ending list of inputs - team member suggestions, executive emails, countless dashboards, and everything coming out of user research. Deciding what goes first on the roadmap feels more like art than science. This is a framework developed to figure out which types of projects make the most sense at each point in time. Ellen illustrates each type of project (art, users, metrics, and team) with one or more specific case studies from her work at Lola, Kickstarter, and Microsoft. This talk can help you re-evaluate how you prioritize your own roadmap, or provide a basis for training new PMs that are joining your team.",

	'description' => "It’s an exciting time to be in tech, but the pathway to a Product Management position remains shrouded in a fog of mystery. Job descriptions are unclear, roles vary from company to company, and there are few educational programs available to shed some light on what set of skills are needed. So what is someone looking to make a transition to a job like this to do? Today Mariah will tackle pinning down what knowledge is needed for a role that is “ambiguous by nature,” and talk about why many people and companies lack understanding of the true scope of the role. Using case studies, Mariah will illustrate the true value a PM brings to both would-be practitioners and team leaders who are interested in learning more about the skills and knowledge needed to be a successful Product Manager.",

	'description' => "Picking the right price for a product is notoriously hard. There are many challenges and potential pitfalls, such as: the amount of resources required to build support for pricing and billing, the possibility of leaving money on the table (or unintentionally turning potential customers away), and the difficulty of testing and iterating on a price once it’s live. At the same time, the infrastructure required to test different pricing has historically been costly. This case study will bring pricing out of the dark and into the light, and help you hypothesize and test different prices in a lightweight way. Along the way, Catherine will share methods and lessons learned from her experience setting the price for FullContact’s new product.",

This case study will highlight how one organization is adopting continuous product discovery practices across the enterprise. It will explore the transformation by the leadership team, by product teams, and by each of the individuals that make up those teams. For companies considering adopting continuous product discovery practices, this case study will give you a blueprint for how to reinforce this transformation and will include gotchas to look out for as you adopt this change.",

	'title' => 'That Time I Wasted 2 Months of Dev Work: When and How to Use Data Effectively',
	'description' => "We’ve all been told to be data-driven, and we know that opinions and intuition are no substitute for good metrics. But what does it really mean to be data-driven when the rubber hits the road? What good are a/b tests if the user base is too small to reach statistical significance? Are year-over-year or month-over-month comparisons ever appropriate? Does qualitative user research have a place in a world of cohort reports and conversion rate graphs? And how can I get my team involved to build data into our culture? In this talk, Vicky will share her experiences leveraging data to build Lucidpress, Lucid Software’s design & layout web app. From user interviews to Design Sprints to multivariate testing, the Lucidpress team has used a wide variety of tools to optimize their product for its 2M+ users. Through real-life examples (like the time they burned 2 months of development time that amounted to nothing), Vicky will share what she’s learned about when and how to use data effectively.",

Research can be a hard sell even when budgets and timelines aren't tight. Victor will walk through the purpose, process, and people needed to carry out efficient and effective research and strategy projects. These projects help inform the vision and strategy of your product. Next time a stakeholder suggests cutting the research, you'll sing a tune so sweet they’ll beg for more.",
