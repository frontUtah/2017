When we align, we arrive at a shared understanding of priorities, efficiencies, and tradeoffs. When we align, the result is purposeful and even beautiful. </br></br>In this keynote, Cameron will discuss three aspects of alignment within systems, not the least of which are design systems, and the remarkable outcomes that are made possible when we align.",

We’re faced with the dilemma of who own’s the decision. We find ourselves justifying a decision based off a set of principles and priorities. Not an uncommon story. </br></br>Balancing the needs of the users, business, team and yourself is certainly a challenge. As designers we’re naturally wired to defend and create for the needs of the user. Business…wants to stay in business, and Development…wants to build amazing forward thinking technology while not drowning its own debt. Lets talk about how we can build amazing products without coming to a stalemate with every conversation.
