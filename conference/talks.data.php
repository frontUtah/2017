	'description' => 'Great product teams are empowered with a vision; organized into co-located, cross-functional, autonomous teams; and motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose. You don’t hire the best and then tell them what to do. But how does that scale? How does autonomy work when there’s multiple autonomous teams that must work together?<br><br>No matter how innovative or proven your processes, structure, or techniques, they can’t be forced into place if they don’t fit the people. Every organization is different, every context is different, and every person is different. Your job as a leader isn’t building process, it’s building trust; and it requires patience. Your team must discover it and own it.<br><br>Understanding your team’s technical skills, operational proficiency, and emotional maturity is crucial as you slowly step back from what, through how, to why. Join me for the story of how Workfront’s international user experience organization doubled in size in one year, reorganized into cross-functionally-led portfolios, assembled a design ops team, produced a design system, embarking on a complete user experience overall of an 18 year old enterprise platform, and developed a culture of accountability, transparency, feedback, and recognition.',

	'description' => 'Product managers and product leaders often focus on understanding customers as the secret to building great products. But that’s just the key to great ideas - the key to great execution is the team. <br><br>The importance of teamwork isn’t a new concept in building products. As product managers and product leaders we spend so much of our time thinking about our process, about how we frame problems, how we scope them, and how we tell stories about them so that we can get our teams motivated to solve them. But to do more than just ship products, to build a truly great product, you have to go further than just figuring out how to define the problem and why it matters for your team. <br><br>This presentation is a story about three people who launched two versions of the same product 10 months apart. It’s a story of how that team went from everything going wrong on launch day to building a best-in-class experience that launched smoothly, and how the difference in those launches was entirely due to how much better the team understood each other as human beings and coworkers.',

Comparisons can be made of research practices at different sized companies, but how does the transition actually happen? How do you know when it is time to move from one research approach to another? This presentation will address how to tell which research stage best fits your business, and what you need to do to level-up your research when the time is right. The story of Jane can help you anticipate how a team navigates these large-scale process changes to become a research powerhouse on the other side.',

But what if we pause, take a step back, and ask ourselves: could there be a radically new way that we can approach creating products that will make it easier for 100X as many people to bring their product ideas to life? This presentation will explore the rich history of other creative industries (like 3D animation and digital publishing) to gain inspiration for how we can completely rethink and transform today’s product design and development practices.',

Amazon changed when they started selling groceries, and then cloud computing, and then original TV shows.<br><br>It is easy to imagine these changes as grand strategic moves, carefully planned and executed by a handful of luminaries. But lasting, meaningful change comes from many small, focused improvements over time. With patience, just one person can make a substantial impact in even the largest organizations.<br><br>Think about something you’d like to change. It might be overwhelming, but be bold: the bigger, the better. What I’d like to do is help you start making that change.<br><br>The good news is that my job is easy: nobody is better at changing than designers and product managers. With the right tools, you can make focused, meaningful improvements to your company’s process, culture, or products.<br><br>I’ll share how writing design principles with your team sets the stage. I’ll tell you how great feedback can fuel change. I’ll share stories of big changes I’ve made, like radically improving the Wall Street Journal’s approach to accessibility.<br><br>At the end, you’ll be able to go back to work and start changing your team for the better, whether you’re a tenured manager or a brand new hire.',

This was the mantra of UserTesting during the recent development and launch of Product Insight, a new application developed to help product teams build better products by leveraging rapid customer feedback. When we build products, we’re constantly refining our understanding of three key questions: who is my customer? what is their problem? what is the best, lightest solution I can build for them? This drives rapid validation & iteration cycles as we build.<br><br>To demonstrate our product development framework, we will discuss the creation of Product Insight to show how UserTesting used customer feedback to (in)validate early ideas, to scope an MVP based on our understanding of customer needs, and to get a product to market quickly. We will also give examples of how we shared our understanding of the three key questions throughout the product development lifecycle to bring our stakeholders & organization along. Attendees will learn practical tips for how they can successfully implement our product development framework to improve time to product success.<br><br>In this session, we will walk through how UserTesting develops:<ul><li>Pragmatic ways to test and validate product ideas at every stage, from conception through launch</li><li>Ideas for sharing what you learn about your customers to build buy-in & alignment across your org for the products you build</li></ul>',

Consider how much better the customer journey can be with a consistent experience across every interaction.

The Lyft driver app has a lot of screen flows/use cases that happen when a passenger is not in the car. These use cases are spread across many different teams!

The insights generated from the EFT program have impacted product road maps and design priorities as well as increased empathy for anyone working on driver products.',
