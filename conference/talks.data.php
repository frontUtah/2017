	'description' => 'Product managers and product leaders often focus on understanding customers as the secret to building great products. But that’s just the key to great ideas - the key to great execution is the team. <br><br>The importance of teamwork isn’t a new concept in building products. As product managers and product leaders we spend so much of our time thinking about our process, about how we frame problems, how we scope them, and how we tell stories about them so that we can get our teams motivated to solve them. But to do more than just ship products, to build a truly great product, you have to go further than just figuring out how to define the problem and why it matters for your team. <br><br>This presentation is a story about three people who launched two versions of the same product 10 months apart. It’s a story of how that team went from everything going wrong on launch day to building a best-in-class experience that launched smoothly, and how the difference in those launches was entirely due to how much better the team understood each other as human beings and coworkers.',

Comparisons can be made of research practices at different sized companies, but how does the transition actually happen? How do you know when it is time to move from one research approach to another? This presentation will address how to tell which research stage best fits your business, and what you need to do to level-up your research when the time is right. The story of Jane can help you anticipate how a team navigates these large-scale process changes to become a research powerhouse on the other side.',

	'description' => 'If you’re a Product Manager, at some point you’ve been asked to create a product strategy. But what exactly does that mean, and where do you begin? Traditionally Product Managers often start developing a product strategy by thinking about the product first (features and functionality), but often times leads to several challenges. Product Managers should consider focusing on the problem they’re trying to solve. Designers, for example, think of the user first, having empathy for the people the product is being designed for. Can Product Managers leverage a design thinking approach to help create product strategies? If so, how does it work? <br><br>At UserTesting we take a design thinking approach to create our product strategy. We teach product managers to think like designers and designers to think like product managers. To demonstrate our methods, we will be discussing case study examples to show how UserTesting brought together people from different teams to collaborate and create a value proposition, see and understand the bigger vision and the steps we took to create the “big vision” for a product strategy. We will give examples of how we leveraged brainstorming, sketching and storyboarding sessions that ultimately creates a story arch that helps discover key points that can eventually communicate an overall product strategy. Attendees will learn how they can successfully implement design thinking to create product strategies the UserTesting way. <br><br> In this session, we will walk through how UserTesting has: <ul><li>Built product strategies with a large distributed group in a way that keeps everyone moving forward fast.</li><li>Communicates and share ideas in a way that motivates and aligns everyone around a common goal.</li><li>Bridges the gap between product management and other teams to create a cohesive strategy.</li></ul>',

But to a customer, it really extends to the end-to-end experience with your entire brand — from acquisition ads, targeted emails, and sponsored content, to the website, into the product, and continued via live chat or other support interactions. Consider how much better the customer journey can be with a consistent experience across every interaction. This presentation will provide a framework on how to build and maintain strong relationships with your marketing and CS counterparts, as well as real examples from my experience at Chatbooks and Ancestry.',
