 	'description' => "The modern-day workplace is getting to be demanding and we as humans continue to demand more from ourselves. Both emerging and seasoned leaders are continuously faced with choices and decisions to make. How we make these decisions impacts our teams, our work, and, most importantly, has a significant impact on our self. Outside of being a parent, being a leader is perhaps the only other role that comes with its fair share of freedom and responsibility. <br /><br />Who or what inspires you to lead? How aware are you to show up as the leader you want to be? Is there a practice or ritual to bring about an authentic, compelling, yet sustainable way to lead? Given her own upbringing as an Indian-American amidst a culture of tolerance and respect, she thrives in the diversity of thought and action. Drawing from her own personal and professional experiences, Chetana’s talk will explore what it means to lead from within and how the current workplace makes it difficult to do so. How our cultural and personal values intersect with who we are as leaders. What drives someone to lead compulsively? <br /><br />Let’s explore following yourself and to lead from a place of compulsion to compassion.",

Come see what we learned in the last 451 days after moving to an org design where each leader is responsible for product, design, and engineering. While not a silver bullet, the new design has delivered on its promises. Teams no longer rely on multiple leaders—or experience the inevitable confusion that follows. They also enjoy less friction as they work together and collaborate more powerfully across teams. Whether you’re a leader, or a contributor, you’ll take home tactical lessons that will improve how you work with other disciplines.",

It helps create new understanding about what’s possible, it provides insights to make a product better, and it helps guide and build momentum.<br /><br />Join me as I talk about discovery work at Travelocity, Ancestry, Bluehost, and other organizations.

Community and culture are naturally occuring in any work environment, and can symbiotically survive without intervention. Given their influence on the health of our team, why not give it an assist? In this talk, Margaret will reflect on the evolution of Google UX since 2007, a period marked by tectonic shifts in technology, a rise in consumer expectations, and the individuation of UX as a discipline. As the UX Director for Google Maps for nine years, she experienced firsthand the throes of constant change and rapid scale, and saw the same for her peers across the company. In 2016, Margaret seeded UX Community & Culture, a program that tackles the challenges and explores the opportunities that tend to fall between the organizational cracks. She’ll share the practical insights that can help you steer a team or organization of any size toward a healthy and thriving team culture.",

// David Merkoski
$talks[] = array(
	'title' => 'Reference design',
	'description' => "Product vision can be a strong force in product design – it drives teams to work towards a shared outcome and provides self-evident answers to “What are we building? And Why?” Teams that are not driven by purpose and intent are rudderless, habitually choosing precedent over innovation, merely copying what already exists in the hopes it will work here too.<br /><br />As a result product vision is often difficult to pin down or name. It’s “something we all share” or “in the deck”. If you open that deck you will find a roadmap with features like “Next Generation Search” or “Shopping 2.0”. This approach leads to unclear and under-used, general meh products. It also leads to team dysfunction, trust issues and ultimately—burnout.<br /><br />So how do you collaboratively create product vision? One that provides enough clarity for an organization to plan, design and build a product a year out, but one that also affords the team responsive and agile shifts as they learn in the market. David Merkoski, former ECD of frog design and startup design advisor will share with Front a new design tool—a Reference Design—that tames the complexity of product vision for startups.<br /><br />Not a design system, nor a set of rules and principles—a Reference Design captures a specific visual rendering of the shared intent and outcomes for a future product in detailed material form. Used in other industries, \"Reference Designs are technical blueprints of the system, they contain essential elements of the system, but are meant to be enhanced or modified as required.\"<br /><br />Through a set of clear artifacts and a focus on language, a Reference Design forges internal agreement of the shared purpose that drives teams forward. A highly visible document, it is always the answer to \"What are you/we doing?\" While it may live in a Sketch file on the cloud, it is also literally hanging on the wall. Everyone should be able point to it... \"That is what we are building.\" It is the reference.<br /><br />Through a series of case studies spanning industries, startup stages and business models, David will explain how using the cyclical process of a Reference Design can open teams up to being their most engaged and invested selves at work. In fact, it becomes quite fun when design is no longer the block and everyone is practically anticipating the next feature to build, seeing the pieces come together. Because when you are design-driven, product-led – work just makes sense.",
