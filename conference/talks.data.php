The principles of how to develop products at each stage seem to stay the same. However, the application of soft and hard skills can differ. In this presentation we will explore various case studies from flegingin start-ups, to Enterprises, to government bureaucracies and how application differed between each stage. By the end the audience will have a better understanding of what skills they need to develop to be successful at their companies stage.",

It can be tempting as a new leader to jump in and start driving for results, command and control style: improve core metrics, make changes to the design, move the needle! Chris Fryer, Chief Product Officer at Homie will show you a completely different approach that leads to longer lasting customer impact while also inspiring trust and commitment from your new team and those that put you in charge.",

	'description' => "Like any other department in an organization, design needs a strategy. A clear path forward, with a shared goal, and the ability to measure progress along the way. This strategy also needs to align with the rest of the organization to ensure we are not only delivering the right products and services, but we are also delivering joy and delight.<br /><br />I'm excited to share with you a design strategy framework I've found to be most successful, and the rise of UX metrics and outcome-driven products, in a recent case study from my current leadership role in crypto at Okcoin.",

	'title' => 'Building products powered by machine learning',
	'description' => "Machine Learning and AI have become buzzwords in recent years. Most software products we build today are deterministic models. In such a model, what’s presented in the experience is fixed and predetermined by humans. In products that utilize machine learning, predictive technology determines what is presented. This is a probabilistic model where the likelihood that something is relevant or likely to be right, is scored or ranked. For example, just because you enter a query and get search results, doesn’t mean that the results are good. The UX of such an experience is not based on design, but on the predictive machine features. From this point of view, a product team working on machine learning capabilities operates differently from the traditional product development model.<br /><br />In this talk, Ha will share some common themes on machine learning products – from ideation to operationalizing machine learning. She will utilize examples from her experience building a search platform at Pluralsight, and working on computer vision and machine learning R&D projects at GoPro.",

	'description' => "The modern-day workplace is getting to be demanding and we as humans continue to demand more from ourselves. Both emerging and seasoned leaders are continuously faced with choices and decisions to make. How we make these decisions impacts our teams, our work, and, most importantly, has a significant impact on our self. Outside of being a parent, being a leader is perhaps the only other role that comes with its fair share of freedom and responsibility.<br /><br />Who or what inspires you to lead? How aware are you to show up as the leader you want to be? Is there a practice or ritual to bring about an authentic, compelling, yet sustainable way to lead? Given her own upbringing as an Indian-American amidst a culture of tolerance and respect, she thrives in the diversity of thought and action. Drawing from her own personal and professional experiences, Chetana’s talk will explore what it means to lead from within and how the current workplace makes it difficult to do so. How our cultural and personal values intersect with who we are as leaders. What drives someone to lead compulsively?<br /><br />Let’s explore following yourself and to lead from a place of compulsion to compassion.",

	'description' => "\"Focus on the people, empower the community, the bring intention and context into all that we do\". This past year placed a magnifying glass on what matters most to each of us. Family, careers, joy, and life fulfillment. Whether you're a seasoned pro, or just getting into product and design you'll learn fast that without strong peer building networks, community, and support the pursuit of life fulfillment can feel like a lonesome path. However, it's 2022 and we live in an age of a technology boom, so many tools, so many opportunities, with limitless potential.<br /><br />In this talk, Drew will reflect on the evolution of GrowthDay, a 2021 Startup that was founded to help bring personal development to the world through the use of tools, community, and life coaching.  Built and founded during COVID, GrowthDay is a cross-platform personal development app. Led by world-renown 3-time New York Times bestselling author and High-performance coach, and CEO Brendon Burchard. GrowthDay had 20 years of research and has been serving the community without an app. You'll see what's possible in 1 year with great intention, responsibility, and empowerment.<br /><br />Drew will also uncover the power of how rituals and routines played into the early success of this platform. Drew will also discuss how he leveraged his training and development platform Next Level UX to develop frameworks around the most important areas of focus when building new companies, teams, and relationships while manifesting a rich learning and high-performance culture.",

	'description' => "If you've spent more than three minutes on LinkedIn lately, you've probably noticed that every team seems to be 'growing like crazy!'. But growth can be a chaotic and frustrating experience depending on how well you prepare for it. What do you do when you find yourself knee-deep in projects that are overlapping, with unclear priorities and ownership—and come to the panic-inducing realization that you're at risk of delivering a severely disjointed product experience? Oh, and let's not forget that the team is growing, and you'll soon have to do the same acrobatics with twice the people.<br /><br />Ingrid will share her experience navigating through the challenge (and opportunity!) of rapid growth at Ivanti and FullStory. How do you establish a clear design vision and strategy for a portfolio of 50+ products? How do you continue to execute well as a team when you double in size in a short amount of time? How do you align your own career development with opportunities that arise in a high-growth environment? By recognizing the challenges that accompany growth and having the tools to address them, you and your team can adapt, thrive, and do great work during seasons of constant change.",

	'description' => "As a product leader, you speak the language of outcomes and realize the value of design in achieving product experiences that people will love. But what to do when there is no design function at your rapidly growing company? You showcase the power of design thinking in products you create. You learn from and work closely with the founder, who becomes your mentor. You take on the challenge to build a design function from the ground up. As demand for thoughtfully designed products increases, you purchase a design agency to accelerate the company-wide transformation. You create a design culture, and a studio to celebrate the creative, quirky, and down-to-earth team values. A vision takes hold on how to truly design at scale, platform-first. In time, all products across the company, now 10 times larger, are imbued with design teams, working together and contributing to a maturing design system. Coming back to the decades-old Platform UI, you lead a talented cross-functional team to deliver ServiceNow’s reimagined, all-new platform experience to thousands of the worlds largest companies: The Next Experience",

	'description' => "Accessibility is about ensuring people can perceive and operate digital interfaces. For sighted people, this can be a difficult problem to solve. There are a plethora of visual experiences and impairments, and solving for one person’s challenge may adversely affect another’s. In other cases, a solution may not actually help the people it is intended to help. For example, dark mode may seem reasonable for photophobia (light sensitive people). However, high contrast text in dark mode can result in optical glare, making text illegible. The way that we can solve for the complexities of individual visual experience is with color personalization.<br /><br />In this talk, Nate will discuss the basics of the human visual system, color science, and how they relate to user interfaces. He will use examples from his work creating Adobe Spectrum’s color system in conjunction with their open source color tool, Leonardo.",
