	'description' => 'Product managers and product leaders often focus on understanding customers as the secret to building great products. But that’s just the key to great ideas - the key to great execution is the team. <br><br>The importance of teamwork isn’t a new concept in building products. As product managers and product leaders we spend so much of our time thinking about our process, about how we frame problems, how we scope them, and how we tell stories about them so that we can get our teams motivated to solve them. But to do more than just ship products, to build a truly great product, you have to go further than just figuring out how to define the problem and why it matters for your team. <br><br>This presentation is a story about three people who launched two versions of the same product 10 months apart. It’s a story of how that team went from everything going wrong on launch day to building a best-in-class experience that launched smoothly, and how the difference in those launches was entirely due to how much better the team understood each other as human beings and coworkers.',

Comparisons can be made of research practices at different sized companies, but how does the transition actually happen? How do you know when it is time to move from one research approach to another? This presentation will address how to tell which research stage best fits your business, and what you need to do to level-up your research when the time is right. The story of Jane can help you anticipate how a team navigates these large-scale process changes to become a research powerhouse on the other side.',

But what if we pause, take a step back, and ask ourselves: could there be a radically new way that we can approach creating products that will make it easier for 100X as many people to bring their product ideas to life? This presentation will explore the rich history of other creative industries (like 3D animation and digital publishing) to gain inspiration for how we can completely rethink and transform today’s product design and development practices.',

	'title' => 'How to build a product strategy with design thinking',
	'description' => 'If you’re a Product Manager, at some point you’ve been asked to create a product strategy. But what exactly does that mean, and where do you begin? Traditionally Product Managers often start developing a product strategy by thinking about the product first (features and functionality), but often times leads to several challenges. Product Managers should consider focusing on the problem they’re trying to solve. Designers, for example, think of the user first, having empathy for the people the product is being designed for. Can Product Managers leverage a design thinking approach to help create product strategies? If so, how does it work? <br><br>At UserTesting we take a design thinking approach to create our product strategy. We teach product managers to think like designers and designers to think like product managers. To demonstrate our methods, we will be discussing case study examples to show how UserTesting brought together people from different teams to collaborate and create a value proposition, see and understand the bigger vision and the steps we took to create the “big vision” for a product strategy. We will give examples of how we leveraged brainstorming, sketching and storyboarding sessions that ultimately creates a story arch that helps discover key points that can eventually communicate an overall product strategy. Attendees will learn how they can successfully implement design thinking to create product strategies the UserTesting way. <br><br> In this session, we will walk through how UserTesting has: <ul><li>Built product strategies with a large distributed group in a way that keeps everyone moving forward fast.</li><li>Communicates and share ideas in a way that motivates and aligns everyone around a common goal.</li><li>Bridges the gap between product management and other teams to create a cohesive strategy.</li></ul>',

But to a customer, it really extends to the end-to-end experience with your entire brand — from acquisition ads, targeted emails, and sponsored content, to the website, into the product, and continued via live chat or other support interactions. Consider how much better the customer journey can be with a consistent experience across every interaction. This presentation will provide a framework on how to build and maintain strong relationships with your marketing and CS counterparts, as well as real examples from my experience at Chatbooks and Ancestry.',

The Lyft driver app has a lot of screen flows/use cases that happen when a passenger is not in the car. These use cases are spread across many different teams! Due to the complexity of the driver experience and the lowered visibility of that experience, we started the Employee Field Testing (EFT) program to get Product Managers, Designers, UX Researchers, Engineers, Content Writers, etc into the drivers seat and directly experiencing the product in real time, on the road, across use cases. The insights generated from the EFT program have impacted product road maps and design priorities as well as increased empathy for anyone working on driver products.',
