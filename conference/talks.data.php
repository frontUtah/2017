The principles of how to develop products at each stage seem to stay the same. However, the application of soft and hard skills can differ. In this presentation we will explore various case studies from flegingin start-ups, to Enterprises, to government bureaucracies and how application differed between each stage. By the end the audience will have a better understanding of what skills they need to develop to be successful at their companies stage.",

	'description' => "Machine Learning and AI have become buzzwords in recent years. Most software products we build today are deterministic models. In such a model, what’s presented in the experience is fixed and predetermined by humans. In products that utilize machine learning, predictive technology determines what is presented. This is a probabilistic model where the likelihood that something is relevant or likely to be right, is scored or ranked. For example, just because you enter a query and get search results, doesn’t mean that the results are good. The UX of such an experience is not based on design, but on the predictive machine features. From this point of view, a product team working on machine learning capabilities operates differently from the traditional product development model.<br /><br />In this talk, Ha will share some common themes on machine learning products – from ideation to operationalizing machine learning. She will utilize examples from her experience building a search platform at Pluralsight, and working on computer vision and machine learning R&D projects at GoPro.",

Both emerging and seasoned leaders are continuously faced with choices and decisions to make. How we make these decisions impacts our teams, our work, and, most importantly, has a significant impact on our self. Outside of being a parent, being a leader is perhaps the only other role that comes with its fair share of freedom and responsibility.<br /><br />Who or what inspires you to lead? How aware are you to show up as the leader you want to be? Is there a practice or ritual to bring about an authentic, compelling, yet sustainable way to lead? Given her own upbringing as an Indian-American amidst a culture of tolerance and respect, she thrives in the diversity of thought and action. Drawing from her own personal and professional experiences, Chetana’s talk will explore what it means to lead from within and how the current workplace makes it difficult to do so. How our cultural and personal values intersect with who we are as leaders. What drives someone to lead compulsively?<br /><br />Let’s explore following yourself and to lead from a place of compulsion to compassion.",

Oh, and let's not forget that the team is growing, and you'll soon have to do the same acrobatics with twice the people.<br /><br />Ingrid will share her experience navigating through the challenge (and opportunity!) of rapid growth at Ivanti and FullStory. How do you establish a clear design vision and strategy for a portfolio of 50+ products? How do you continue to execute well as a team when you double in size in a short amount of time?

When you are asked to deliver in half the time, with a quarter the the team size required, and across 15 different devices and platforms on day one into a highly competitive and saturated market? 

	<br /><br />

We have all heard the term 'building the plane while flying it', but few leaders are equipped for the type of tools required for the tightropes and trapezes you will embark on. This was the task at hand when developing and launching Discovery+ to 25 million subscribers, across 13 countries and 12 languages.

<br /><br />

In this talk, Shawn will discuss what you need to do to survive take-off, a trip around the sun, and bringing everyone together to succeed in designing, developing and launching a global streaming service in record time. Shawn will highlight key pitfalls and important areas to achieve success through adaptive intelligence, quick decisions and trade-offs that keep the customer and the company culture at the center focus.

Shawn will also share stories and examples of how he used collaboration tools and tactics, including using intuition and instinct with real time data to produce a Design led MLP (Most Lovable Product) that ultimately shifted the trajectory of the company and resulted in one of the largest media mergers in history.",

You learn from and work closely with the founder, who becomes your mentor. You take on the challenge to build a design function from the ground up. As demand for thoughtfully designed products increases, you purchase a design agency to accelerate the company-wide transformation. You create a design culture, and a studio to celebrate the creative, quirky, and down-to-earth team values. A vision takes hold on how to truly design at scale, platform-first. In time, all products across the company, now 10 times larger, are imbued with design teams, working together and contributing to a maturing design system.

There are a plethora of visual experiences and impairments, and solving for one person’s challenge may adversely affect another’s. In other cases, a solution may not actually help the people it is intended to help. For example, dark mode may seem reasonable for photophobia (light sensitive people). However, high contrast text in dark mode can result in optical glare, making text illegible. The way that we can solve for the complexities of individual visual experience is with color personalization.<br /><br />In this talk, Nate will discuss the basics of the human visual system, color science, and how they relate to user interfaces.

This is the exact situation I faced when I was hired at USANA. My development team was stuck, monitoring a legacy system while wanting to build a better system using the latest and greatest technologies.  This presented a bigger problem however as my team is responsible for the commission payments to all of USANA’s associates around the world requiring constant update to respond to executive requests and international laws.  In sum, more obstacles were presented making the problem grow more ominous and seemingly impossible to overcome.

Over a couple weekends, we put together a website that would generate random Utah-themed flags and allow people to customize the designs to their liking. The site was meant to be fun, playful and even a little  bit sarcastic—poking a little fun at Utah and the seriousness of flag design (vexillology). 

<br /><br />

Over the period of just a few months the The Flag Machine received local, national, and industry attention and received over 50,000 visitors from all over the world who helped Utah receive record numbers of official flag submissions. 

<br /><br />

The Flag Machine was a weekend hobby design project—but it inspired and unlocked several ideas about design, community participation, and software interactions that all contributed to its success. 

<br /><br />

In this presentation to the Front audiences, we'd like to share our story and some unique ideas about software and design that we learned along the way, including:
<ul>
<li> The value of creative outlets outside of your day job</li>
<li> The power of randomness and constraint</li>
<li> Using the computer as a tool to help generate thousands, even millions of design options (vs. three variations)</li>
<li> Building interfaces that are fun for anyone to use, including disabled or people with low motor function</li>
<li> The strange world of vexillology (design of flags)</li>
<li> The excitement of building tools that empower people to be creative.</li>
<li> Community engagement and lay person design vs. design snobbism</li></ul>",
