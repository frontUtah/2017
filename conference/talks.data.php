	'description' => "For years Pluralsight reaped the benefits of cross-functional teams but relied on a functional leadership org design. Come see what we learned in the last 451 days after moving to an org design where each leader is responsible for product, design, and engineering. While not a silver bullet, the new design has delivered on its promises. Teams no longer rely on multiple leaders—or experience the inevitable confusion that follows. They also enjoy less friction as they work together and collaborate more powerfully across teams. Whether you’re a leader, or a contributor, you’ll take home tactical lessons that will improve how you work with other disciplines.",

After completing significant discovery work, you've become very invested in the problem and are excited about possible solutions … But you realize the right decision for the business is to pivot. In this presentation, I'll discuss my experience moving away from a favorite project and what I learned from the process - how to fail faster without the feeling of failure.",

	'description' => "The modern-day workplace is getting to be demanding and we as humans continue to demand more from ourselves. Both emerging and seasoned leaders are continuously faced with choices and decisions to make. How we make these decisions impacts our teams, our work, and, most importantly, has a significant impact on our self. Outside of being a parent, being a leader is perhaps the only other role that comes with its fair share of freedom and responsibility. <br /><br />Who or what inspires you to lead? How aware are you to show up as the leader you want to be? Is there a practice or ritual to bring about an authentic, compelling, yet sustainable way to lead? Given her own upbringing as an Indian-American amidst a culture of tolerance and respect, she thrives in the diversity of thought and action. Drawing from her own personal and professional experiences, Chetana’s talk will explore what it means to lead from within and how the current workplace makes it difficult to do so. How our cultural and personal values intersect with who we are as leaders. What drives someone to lead compulsively? <br /><br />Let’s explore following yourself and to lead from a place of compulsion to compassion.",
