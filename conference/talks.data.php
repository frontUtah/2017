In this onboarding case study, Vicki will walk you through how we learned to design using intuition, blending science and design research to create a solution that met our users’ needs.",

Ever become pre-occupied with your tools/systems only to find that you haven’t solved any real problems for your users at the end of the day? </br></br>In this talk Stephen and Eli will explore the balance to be made between these extremes. They’ll talk about how to detect warning signs of extremism, becoming aware of subconscious biases in your workflow today, and how to challenge established paradigms to drive to a healthier, more productive work day for both you and your team.",

We’re faced with the dilemma of who own’s the decision. We find ourselves justifying a decision based off a set of principles and priorities. Not an uncommon story. </br></br>Balancing the needs of the users, business, team and yourself is certainly a challenge. As designers we’re naturally wired to defend and create for the needs of the user. Business…wants to stay in business, and Development…wants to build amazing forward thinking technology while not drowning its own debt. Lets talk about how we can build amazing products without coming to a stalemate with every conversation.",
