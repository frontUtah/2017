In this Headspace case study, Vicki will walk you through her design process in detail, which blends user insights and behavioral science. But more than that, she will shine a light on a trend in our industry, and leave you with an actionable idea for how to create products that truly add value.",

By establishing and maintaining a company-wide design language and design system implementation, teams are better equipped to ensure consistency, reduce duplication of work, and improve overall design and code quality.",

	'description' => "Research can be scary. But the change in perspective that happens after you spend time connecting with customers is powerful, and the truths you learn are worth it. We're going to talk about how to bring more of that power to your work and maybe make it a little less scary. I like to call it the research mindset. It helps create new understanding about what’s possible, it provides insights to make a product better, and it helps guide and build momentum.<br /><br />Join me as I talk about discovery work at Travelocity, Ancestry, Bluehost, and other organizations. You’ll learn how to conduct research that delivers results, changes behavior, and creates a research mindset within your organization.",

$talks[] = array(
	'title' => 'Leading from compulsion to compassion',
	'description' => "The modern-day workplace is getting to be demanding and we as humans continue to demand more from ourselves. Both emerging and seasoned leaders are continuously faced with choices and decisions to make. How we make these decisions impacts our teams, our work, and, most importantly, has a significant impact on our self. Outside of being a parent, being a leader is perhaps the only other role that comes with its fair share of freedom and responsibility. <br /><br />Who or what inspires you to lead? How aware are you to show up as the leader you want to be? Is there a practice or ritual to bring about an authentic, compelling, yet sustainable way to lead? Given her own upbringing as an Indian-American amidst a culture of tolerance and respect, she thrives in the diversity of thought and action. Drawing from her own personal and professional experiences, Chetana’s talk will explore what it means to lead from within and how the current workplace makes it difficult to do so. How our cultural and personal values intersect with who we are as leaders. What drives someone to lead compulsively? <br /><br />Let’s explore following yourself and to lead from a place of compulsion to compassion.",

As one sales VP explained, “The percentage of customers we could sell this to is in the single digits.” There were discussions of killing the product completely. Six months later, we launched it publicly to all customers, and it went on to sell millions in the following year. Here’s how we got there, and how you can too.<br /><br />With most products, there can be many obstacles to product-market fit:<ul><li>Wrong product</li><li>Wrong market</li><li>Wrong message</li></ul><br /><br />I’ll cover specific tactics we used to understand the problem in all three of these areas, including:<ul><li>An internal listening tour</li><li>JTBD interviews with customers</li><li>Analyzing data</li><li>Exploring the ways customers were hacking the product</li><li>Evaluating against competitor options</li><li>And more...</li></ul><br /><br />We’ll also discuss how we used that research to transform the product and its appeal… and the things we missed that created unexpected results.",
