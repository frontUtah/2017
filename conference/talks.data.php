	'description' => "If you've spent more than three minutes on LinkedIn lately, you've probably noticed that every team seems to be 'growing like crazy!'. But growth can be a chaotic and frustrating experience depending on how well you prepare for it. What do you do when you find yourself knee-deep in projects that are overlapping, with unclear priorities and ownership—and come to the panic-inducing realization that you're at risk of delivering a severely disjointed product experience? Oh, and let's not forget that the team is growing, and you'll soon have to do the same acrobatics with twice the people.<br /><br />Ingrid will share her experience navigating through the challenge (and opportunity!) of rapid growth at Ivanti and FullStory. How do you establish a clear design vision and strategy for a portfolio of 50+ products? How do you continue to execute well as a team when you double in size in a short amount of time? How do you align your own career development with opportunities that arise in a high-growth environment? By recognizing the challenges that accompany growth and having the tools to address them, you and your team can adapt, thrive, and do great work during seasons of constant change.",
