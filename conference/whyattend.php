			<h2>Why Attend</h2>
			<p class="about-reasons-why">Front was built around the idea of sharing ideas and helping one another learn from other people’s experiences. Attending the Front Conference you’ll get to meet and learn from people that have been building digital experiences for years. You’ll learn how others are solving problems, celebrating successes, and building cultures of creativity and innovation.

We believe product management and product design play a central role in the success of a product. We believe we need better, smarter people to lead product. We believe in human relationships and learning from each other through examples. We believe in kindness, generousity, transparency and a willingness to share.
