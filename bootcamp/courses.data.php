	'description' => "Why do so many teams get stuck in the weeds? Why do so many smart teams end up delivering over budget and not on time? It’s because they start to build too soon. They jump right into wireframes and design before they’ve spent enough time establishing their product story. Storyboaring is a critical activity to product development because it forces us to develop a deeper understanding of the people we are designing for. It forces us to establish the context and the characters before we start debating button radius, layout, styles of forms, navigation, and more.<br /><br />In this workshop, you will walk through the process of creating a storyboard and wireframes of various fidelity for a practice product. You will gain the practice and confidence to go back to your team and begin storyboarding so you can create smarter and more effective wireframes.<br /><br />After participating in the workshop, attendees will leave with the following learning objectives:<ul><li>Understand the role of storytelling in UX</li><li>Know how to apply storytelling principles including including storyboarding and character development</li><li>Know how and when to integrate storyboarding into your product development process</li><li>Learn how to evangelize storyboarding throughout your team </li><li>Learn how to apply storytelling principles to help with communication in your team and also when selling ideas and designs to colleagues and clients</li><li>Understand where wireframes fit into the product development process</li><li>Know the various levels of wireframe detail and when to use each</li><li>Gain practical tips for creating wireframes</li><li>Understand how to present wireframes and integrate the storyboard into wireframe reviews</li></ul>",

The approach establishes a common, simple vocabulary that can be applied to any problem/solution space, and can scale up and down depending on the complexity of the challenge. Have your coffee.

How do you recruit the right people for a study, disseminate your inspiration to the rest of your team, and build in regular checkpoints to make sure you solve the most relevant problems right up to launch and beyond?  How can you use data to discover use cases and preferences that users can’t articulate?

Humans are inherently complicated and multifaceted. There is no generic way to lead all people. In a phrase, leadership, or the lake of it, in product organizations is the leading reason for failure. Hiring the right leaders or nurturing the existing people into positions of leadership is complicated and generally misunderstood.

We will talk about one of the hardest and most important parts of leadership, managing team members who are dropping the ball. This is easier said than done. First, we need to understand why the ball is being dropped (system, workload, communication, soft skills, disengagement). If it is a system or workload issue, how do we co-author a solution with the team? If it is a communication or soft skills issue, how do we coach the individual? And if it is a disengagement issue, how do we have the hard conversation with our team member that they must step up or move on.",
