						<h3>Remote User Testing: How to Test Your Designs From The Comfort of Your Herman Miller Aeron Chair</h3>
						<p>User research is fun. Driving, flying, biking or ubering to get to the user research? Less fun (Not to mention a huge time waster).</p>
						<p>As a firm believer in work-from-homing and the potential productivity boostage it can bring, and possessing an anthropological zeal for exploring my own inner introvert, I would like to share with you the skills, techniques, and tools necessary to make remote user testing as successful as in-person testing. In this workshop you can expect to take actual prototypes (either your own or examples provided) and work to plan, build, and perform both live and self-moderated (on-demand), remote, user testing campaigns.</p>
