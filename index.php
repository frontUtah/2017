		<h2>2020 Case Study Conference postponed</h2>
			<p>The health and safety of our attendees, speakers, sponsors, and staff is 
				our highest priority. After monitoring developments of the coronavirus 
				pandemic and considering the latest recommendations and requests of major 
				global health organizations and governments, we have decided to postpone 
				the 2020 Front UX & Product Management Case Study Conference. </p>
			<p>It is with sad hearts that we delay this event. We have been so eager to 
				gather with you again for the sixth year. After a year of research and 
				planning, we have crafted a program of some of the best and brightest 
				practitioners in the industry and set to be our most exciting and 
				inspiring event yet. Postponing the event, however, is the right thing 
				to do.</p>
			<p>The good news is that Front isn’t being cancelled. Instead of two 
				separate events year year, the Case Study Conference will be combined 
				with our Workshop Series in November, for a single, large, multi-format 
				event. We will also be expanding our usual schedule to include round 
				tables, a welcome reception, yoga, a group meditation session, a 
				service project, networking dinners, and an after-party.</p>
			<p>The combined event will be 9-13 November 2020, with the workshops 
				Tuesday and Wednesday and the talks Thursday and Friday. More details 
				about the schedule will be available shortly on our website.</p>

		<h2>Building amazing product teams</h2>
		<p>Creating amazing products requires more than brilliant ideas, 
			meticulously crafted interactions, perfect pixels, and cutting-edge 
			technology—it requires a fanatical focus on users and a commitment 
			to producing something that is both useful and desirable. It 
			requires cross-functional teams that listen, iterate, and 
			learn.<br /><br />Front is the product conference for UX designers 
			and product managers. It's a practitioner’s conference. Attendees 
			come for an education, real world, from-the-trenches case studies, 
			and hands-on training from their peers. It's four days of learning 
			and growth, providing answers to deep organizational questions and 
			insights into how to validate and solve the right problems in the 
			right way.</br ></br ><a href="/about"><em>Learn more about Front's
