			<h2>2020 Case Study Conference postponed</h2>
			<p>The health and safety of our attendees, speakers, sponsors, and staff is 
				our highest priority. After monitoring developments of the coronavirus 
				pandemic and considering the latest recommendations and requests of major 
				global health organizations and governments, we have decided to postpone 
				the 2020 Front UX & Product Management Case Study Conference. </p>
			<p>It is with sad hearts that we delay this event. We have been so eager to 
				gather with you again for the sixth year. After a year of research and 
				planning, we have crafted a program of some of the best and brightest 
				practitioners in the industry and set to be our most exciting and 
				inspiring event yet. Postponing the event, however, is the right thing 
				to do.</p>
			<p>The good news is that Front isn’t being cancelled. Instead of two 
				separate events year year, the Case Study Conference will be combined 
				with our Workshop Series in November, for a <a href="/conference">single, large, multi-format 
				event</a>. We will also be expanding our usual schedule to include round 
				tables, a welcome reception, yoga, a group meditation session, a 
				service project, networking dinners, and an after-party.</p>
			<p>The combined event will be 10-13 November 2020, with the workshops 
				Tuesday and Wednesday and the talks Thursday and Friday. More details 
				about the schedule are available <a href="/conference/schedule">here</a>.</p>
			<p>If you have already purchased tickets, you don’t need to do anything; your tickets will automatically be transitioned to the new schedule. 
				If you have not, we encourage you to <a href="/conference/register">register now</a> to reserve your 
				spot and take advantage of early bird pricing. The event will sell 
				out and there are limited seats in the workshops. Tickets will be 
				sold as a combination for the talks and workshops, or for just the 
				talks alone. And yes. We realize things are still uncertain. Rest assured that tickets are fully refundable until 30 days prior to the event."</p>
			<p>We appreciate your flexibility and support during this time. We would 
				also like to thank <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> and all of our other wonderful sponsors 
				for their support and collaboration in making these events a success. 
				Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the coronavirus 
				situation.</p>

						<dd class="accordion-content answer">The health and safety of our attendees, speakers, sponsors, and staff is our highest priority. Spending time together is a key value of our events, but limiting gatherings of groups is critical in the abatement of the coronavirus pandemic. Thus, we are postponing the conference to November when we will be able to safely gather. We're also excited about the opportunity it provides us to host a larger, multi-format event.</dd>
